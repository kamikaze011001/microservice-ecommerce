# Project Memory

A memory system that **lives in the repo** to: (1) help Claude/AI agents catch up on work
across sessions, and (2) help newcomers onboard quickly. Everything is plain markdown,
version-controlled — memory that travels with git.

## Structure

| Path | Lifetime | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `MEMORY.md` | Continuously updated | **Index** — one line per memory, auto-loaded at session start |
| `decisions/` | Durable, append-only | Architecture/design decisions + **rationale** (ADR-lite) |
| `conventions/` | Durable | Project conventions + gotchas encountered |
| `HANDOFF.md` | Ephemeral, overwritten | WIP state: what is in progress, the next step |
| `sessions/` | Append, per day | Per-session progress summaries |

## How it works

- **Session start:** the `.claude/hooks/load-memory.sh` (SessionStart) hook injects
  `MEMORY.md` + `HANDOFF.md`, then asks Claude to read the files listed under "Context to
  Load". Decisions/conventions are read lazily — only when relevant — to save context budget.
- **Session end:** the `.claude/hooks/remind-save.sh` (Stop) hook nudges once if there are
  unsaved changes → run the `/save-memory` skill to distill the four content types above.

To turn the save-nudge off, remove the `remind-save.sh` Stop entry from
`.claude/settings.json`. The SessionStart load hook can stay on its own.

## Where to codify a rule (important)

Memory files injected by the SessionStart hook reach the **main session only** — subagents
spawned via the Agent tool (executor, code-reviewer, …) do **not** receive them; they only get
`CLAUDE.md`. So:

- A rule that must apply **everywhere, including subagents** → put it in `CLAUDE.md` (and a
  PreToolUse hook if it must be enforced deterministically). Keep the *rationale* in a memory file.
- Context-specific catch-up (what we decided, what's in progress) → memory files here.

## For newcomers

Read in order: `MEMORY.md` (overview) → `decisions/` (why things are the way they are) →
`conventions/` (rules to follow). Skip `HANDOFF.md` / `sessions/` if you only need to
understand the project.

## Writing rules
- 1 file = 1 fact. Small files, kebab-case names.
- `decisions/` is append-only — if a decision changes, add a new file; do not edit the old one.
- Every memory added/changed → update one line in `MEMORY.md`.
