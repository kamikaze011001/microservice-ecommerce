# deploy/ deployment structure

This directory consolidates deployment artifacts for three target environments:
**docker-compose** (fast inner loop), **minikube** (local Kubernetes), and
**AWS EKS** (cloud).

## Status

This is a work-in-progress refactor. See:
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-01-deploy-refactor-design.md`.

## Target layout

```text
deploy/
├── charts/microecom/   # Helm umbrella chart
├── compose/            # docker-compose files
├── terraform/          # AWS infrastructure
├── secrets/            # canonical secret definitions and contexts
├── seed/               # canonical seed data
├── scripts/            # environment-aware deployment scripts
└── images/             # image build definitions
```

## Current minikube workflow

```bash
make k8s-bootstrap
make k8s-tunnel
make k8s-status
make k8s-down
```

Kustomize remains in use until the Helm migration phase.

Host image builds push through `localhost:5001`; minikube nodes pull those
repositories through the registry addon's `localhost:5000` proxy.
